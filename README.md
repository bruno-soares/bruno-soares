Hi! I am Bruno Soares (he/him).

I am a quantitative researcher and adjunct professor at the University of Regina. Check more about my lab here: [in construction].

In summary, I use data science tools to understand the patterns and processes related to species distribution, mostly using aquatic ecosystems in the Neotropics as study models. I also create open tools to merge different sources of information in a systematic way.

Some of the stuff I am working on right now include:
ðŸŒ± Global variation in the structure and functioning of aquatic food webs
ðŸŒ± Tools to create phylogenies from open, large databases
ðŸŒ± Intra- and interspecific variation in prey-predator interactions and functional traits
ðŸŒ± Spatial and temporal variables structuring ecological communities
ðŸŒ± Global North and Global South patterns in scientific recognition and resources
